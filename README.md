4-digits Speedometer (+ Odometer + Altimeter + Clock) for DIY all-terrain vehicles (ATV) with PULSE output

Speedometer is designed for DIY all-terrain vehicles (ATV). It has large bright 4-digit display (14 mm symbols) and
indicates speed, distance, altitude, satellite time. May be used as specific speed signal source for automotive
engines that uses ABS system sensors data (to compute vehicle speed).
Speedometer can transmit correct speed pulse to ABS block (replaces original ABS sensor). This fully tested with
engine Volkswagen Touran TDI 2.0 AZV (2004).

If vehicle body shields GPS signal, you can connect active GPS antenna.

All software and hardware designs are available here.
